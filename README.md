Name(can be changed later):
Allergies
Survival/Roguelike with horror elements. Medical Learning Game.
(For reference, look at the Binding Of Isaac, or Enter The Gungeon)
A dog is inside a herbalist's house. The herbalist is gone on vacation. The dog's goal is to leave the houseâ€¦ alive. This dog is allergic to many things, so he has to survive the multiple allergens that wander the house. And due to this dog having schizophrenia (and for the sake of representation), he sees said allergens as physical monsters that chase and try to kill him.
